 Here’s a breakdown of the steps involved:

1. **User Request**: The process begins with a user making a request.
2. **Generate**: The system generates an initial response based on the user’s request.
3. **Reflect**: The generated response is then reflected upon, allowing for evaluation and improvement.
4. **Reflections**: This step involves critiquing the initial response, noting its merits, and identifying areas for revision.
5. **Repeat**: The reflection process can be repeated multiple times (N times) to refine the response further.

The overall flow emphasizes a cycle of generation and reflection to enhance the quality of responses provided to users.

This process happens using langchain and autogen.
